==============================
      LEVEL 2 - THE RIGHT PATH
==============================

Welcome to Level 2 of this challenge!

This time, you won’t be cracking a simple password.
The binary expects a very specific sequence of values... 
Find the correct path, and you’ll get the FLAG.

RULES;
- The program will ask you for several numbers, one step at a time.
- If you enter a wrong value, it will reset you back to the start.
- Only the correct sequence will lead you to victory.

HINT;
"Every choice opens a door... but only logic will show you the way."

TO RUN;
In the repo folder, type ;
-----------
```
sudo chmod +x game02/seq_find
./seq_find
```

Good luck !!
